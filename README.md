# NFL4thDownConversion_SportsAnalyicsProject
"Fourth &amp; Go" analyzes NFL play-by-play data to identify key predictors of 4th down success. I cleaned data in R and built a logistic regression model in SPSS to quantify variables like yards-to-go. The result is an interpretable framework that helps coaches make data-driven "go-or-no-go" decisions.
