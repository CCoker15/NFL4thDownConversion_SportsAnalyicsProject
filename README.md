# NFL4thDownConversion_SportsAnalyicsProject
In my project titled "Fourth & Go," I conducted a comprehensive analysis of NFL play-by-play data from the 2024 season to determine the most significant predictors of fourth-down conversion success. Utilizing R to source and clean data from nflfastr and SPSS to perform a hierarchical logistic regression, I modeled the probability of success based on two distinct blocks of variables: situational controls (such as yards-to-go, score differential, and Net DVOA) and active coaching decisions (such as play type, formation, and tempo). The analysis quantified the impact of these variables—highlighting "yards-to-go" as a critical determinant—and translated the statistical findings into interpretable visualizations and an actionable framework to assist coaching staffs in making data-driven "go-or-no-go" decisions in high-leverage situations.
